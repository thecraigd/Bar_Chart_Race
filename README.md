# Bar_Chart_Race
Making Bar Chart Races in Matplotlib using 'gif' and 'bar-chart-race' packages

After seeing this kind of visualisation doing the rounds I wanted to try my hand at making my own.

Income_self.ipynb is the code I put together to make a (fairly rudimentary, but still effective) version. The day I posted mine on twitter (@craigdoesdata) I saw that Ted Petrou (@TedPetrou) had released a nice little package, bar-chart-race, to make it easy to do the same thing. So today I gave it a try using that. income-bar-chart-race-package.ipynb is the result of that.
